# GodotLumberyardBistro
A port of the popular "Lumberyard Bistro" scene in the Godot Engine originally created by elite3d studios. This project was created primarily as a simple demo environment/starting point to be used in other personal projects.

The final scene has been optimized to run on a wide variety of hardware while maintaining its original visual fidelity (running at ~50â€“60 fps at 1080p on an Intel Arc iGPU (4 Xe cores)).

Notably, this repository contains a cleaned and minimized [`.glb` version](assets/lumberyard_bistro/lumberyard_bistro.glb) of the original mesh, which has been optimized for easy use in other projects. Meshes and materials have been deduplicated wherever possible, with mesh transforms mostly corrected. Textures have been downsampled based on mesh sizes. Animations from the original scene have been adjusted to be fully loopable. 

The `.glb` should be easy to import into other software, though embedded normal maps may need to be inverted depending on the engine. Note that larger modifications, which deviate more significantly from the original scene, were implemented separately through a Godot [import script](assets/lumberyard_bistro/lumberyard_bistro_import.gd).
